This **partials** directory is where to put snippets of CSS that can be
`@import`ed into other Sass files. Organize your partials to match the
structure of the site, e.g. header, content, footer, sidebar, etc.  If that's
not enough, then make partials for more specific elements, e.g. submitbutton,
textbox, and typography.
